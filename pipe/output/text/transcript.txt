 Let's discuss solved problem 1 on asymptotic notations. In this lecture we are going to discuss the solved problem on asymptotic notations. Let's see the problem. problem is let f n is n square log n and g n is n times log n to the power 10. These 2 are the positive functions of n which of the following statements is correct. These are the statements and we need to identify the correct statement. The first statement is fn equal to bico of gn and gn0 equal to bico of fn. The second statement is gn equal to bico of fn and fn0 equal to bico of gn. The third statement is fn0 equal to bico of gn and gn0 equal to
