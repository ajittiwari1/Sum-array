Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics describing the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. Unlike classical physics, it's probabilistic, predicting only the likelihood of finding a particle in a particular place or state. Key principles include wave-particle duality, where particles can act like particles or waves depending on observation, and superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states before settling into a definite state upon measurement.
